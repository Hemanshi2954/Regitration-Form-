Project Overview:
This project implements a user registration system for the Bharat Intern website. Users can create accounts by providing their details
through a registration form. The submitted data is validated on the client-side (JavaScript) and then securely sent to the server for 
storage in a MongoDB database.

Technology Stack

Front-end:
HTML: Structures the registration form and user interface.
CSS: Styles the form elements and user interface for a visually appealing experience.
JavaScript: Handles form validation, user interactions, and sending data to the server using AJAX or a similar approach.


Back-end:
Node.js (or a server-side language): Runs the server-side script that interacts with the database.
Express.js (or a web framework): Provides a framework for building the server and handling HTTP requests.
Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library that simplifies interaction with the MongoDB database.
MongoDB: A NoSQL document database that stores user registration data.
